# Coding Sandbox

Welcome to **Coding Sandbox**, a personal repository containing an assortment of scripts and code experiments. This repository is a collection of utility scripts, code snippets, and small projects, each organized for easy navigation and reuse.

These are scripts that i created to help my lazy ass

## 📜 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- 💡 **Organize and manage** miscellaneous scripts for easy access and reuse.
- 🚀 **Experiment with** new coding techniques, technologies, and solutions.
- 🔄 **Provide reusable snippets** for tasks ranging from automation to API integrations.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each script is stored in its own folder. The folder name is a short, descriptive label (1-3 words) that summarizes the script’s purpose. This makes it easy to quickly identify and access the scripts you need.

```
/coding-sandbox
    /EXAMPLE-hello-server
    /Template
```

### Example Folders:
- **EXAMPLE-hello-server**: A simple example server setup script.
- **Template**: This folder contains template files that will be used when creating new script folders. Use these files as a starting point for organizing and structuring new scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-sandbox.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the folder containing the script you want to use:
   ```bash
   cd coding-sandbox/EXAMPLE-hello-server
   ```

3. **Run the script** by following the instructions provided in each script’s README (if available). If not, inspect the code to understand how to use it.

## 🛠️ Script Usage

Each script comes with its own specific instructions or can be easily understood by reviewing the code. The **Template** folder contains boilerplate files that you can use to create new script folders. Basic examples of script usage can be found in the individual folders. Feel free to tweak them for your needs!
